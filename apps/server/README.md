# server

This folder contains my own server. I use it as my playground to gain knowledge and experience.
See the detailed documentation by visiting `/docs` or the [documentation](./documentation) project.

## Start the server

Use `docker compose up` to start all services or `docker compose up documentation` to start the
docs only.
Or use `yarn start` inside [documentation](./documentation) to see the docs.
