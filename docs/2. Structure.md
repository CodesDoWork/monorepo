# Project Structure

This project is a NX monorepo, containing multiple projects and plugins.
Thus, to keep things simple and organized, there are some rules to follow:

## Repo Rules

- Project name = path to project directory, separated by `-` without the `packages` folder.
  E.g. `just` for `packages/just` and `just-documentation` for `packages/just/documentation`.
- Project targets are inferred via plugins if possible to avoid duplicated tasks.
- Plugins are located in the [`nx-plugins`](../packages/nx-plugins) folder.
- Projects which are generic and can be reused are located in the [`shared`](../packages/shared) folder.
- Workspace specific projects are located in the [`workspace`](../packages/workspace) folder.

## Env

With the [`nx-plugins-secrets-manager`](../packages/nx-plugins/secrets-manager) plugin, `.env` files can be generated
from Bitwarden secrets using `.env.secure.yaml` config files.
Use the following command to generate them:

```sh
nx g env-file <stages> <user> <password>
```

### Options

- **stages**: Comma separated list of stages to use, e.g. `DEV,PROD` to use `DEV` first and `PROD` as fallback.
- **user**: Bitwarden username
- **password**: Bitwarden password
