# Getting started

## What problem do I want to solve?

With my projects I want to learn more about software development, administration and
security, documentation, testing, CI/CD, new technology and much more.

I can do this in my own, personal environment, playing, testing out and, having fun.
Whilst my focus lies on learning, gaining experience and figuring out what to do and what not to do,
I also want to create software that is really helping me or other people out.

## So, what should my projects have in common?

- Solve a problem, which has no good solution yet (or it's just a small piece of code)
- Gain me useful knowledge and experience
- Have a creative solution or use new technology
- Are well-designed in terms of DX, UX **and** UI
- Are fun to work on
