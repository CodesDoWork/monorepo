# just-maintenance

This package provides a cloudflare worker via wrangler, which shows a maintenance site using astro.
**Only deploy when services are unavailable to indicate the down status. Services will not be when the worker is
running.**

Use the following commands to control the worker after logging in to wrangler:

**deploy**:
````sh
nx deploy-maintenance just-maintenance
````

**delete**:
````sh
nx delete-maintenance just-maintenance
````
